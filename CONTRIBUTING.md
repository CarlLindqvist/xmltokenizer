# Contributing

Hi, thank you for showing interest in this project. I would be grateful to receive feedback and any form of help.

If you have trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a [pull request][prs] and mention me to review the changes.

If you plan to do major changes, here are few guidelines to follow:

1. Check the [open issues][issues] and [pull requests][prs] for existing discussions.
1. Open an [issue][issues] first, to discuss new feature or enhancement.
1. Write the code with tests, and make sure it passes locally and on CI.
1. Open a pull request, and reference the relevant issue(s).
1. After receiving feedback, squash your commits and wrap them in an informative message.

Have fun!
